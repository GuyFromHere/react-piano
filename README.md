# react-piano

A simple MIDI piano interface using [soundfont-player](https://github.com/danigb/soundfont-player). Use the select elements to change instruments or alternate octaves.

This is still in the experimental stage so I have not styled anything yet...

## How to use

Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/GuyFromHere/react-piano.git`.

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

Start the app with `npm run start`.

Browse to `http://localhost:3000`.

Set an octave and an instrument using the select elements, then click the piano keys or use the bottom two letter rows of your keyboard to play.

## TBD
* Lots of styling!
* Horizonal scrolling through keys rather than using a select for octave 
* Musical notation
* Record / playback
* Effects (reverb, delay, oscillation)
